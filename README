CVPI is a C library providing functions for hardware accelerated
computer vision on mobile and embedded platforms. See the see CVPI
manual in the doc directory for details.

CVPI is distributed under the terms of the LGPLv3, see file
"COPYING.LIB" for details.

Functions may or may not work properly but should not cause your
program to crash.  All functions have been tested for stability but
not all for correctness. All testing, so far, has been exclusive to
the Raspberry Pi.

The programs cvpi_sample_motion_detection.sh and
cvpi_sample_motion_detection_continuous.sh require that `ImageMagick'
be installed. cvpi_sample_motion_detection_continuous.sh requires that
`feh' be installed.

CVPI has only been successfully tested on Raspbian.

The current Autotools build does not work.

The project can be built with SCons. 
The SConstruct and tests/SConstript files must be edited 
to change build settings, specifically the -D flag values.

CVPI_CAREFUL can be set to 1 or 0. 1 will check for errors after 
every OpenVG function call. 0 will only check for errors after
memory allocation functions.

CVPI_LOGGING can be set to 0, 1, or 2. 0: no logging will occur.
1:logging will be synchronous. 2: logging will be asynchronous.

CVPI_ASSEMBLY should be kept at 1 for now.
HAVE_BCM_HOST should also be kept at 1 for now.

CVPI has only been tested on the Raspberry Pi, but may support other
platforms.
