The current Autotools build does not work.

The project can be build with SCons. 
The SConstruct and tests/SConstript files must be edited 
to change build settings, specifically the -D flag values.

CVPI_CAREFUL can be set to 1 or 0. 1 will check for errors after 
every OpenVG function call. 0 will only check for errors after
memory allocation functions.

CVPI_LOGGING can be set to 0, 1, or 2. 0: no logging will occurr.
1:logging will be synchronous. 2: logging will be asynchronous.

CVPI_ASSEMBLY should be kept at 1 for now.
HAVE_BCM_HOST should also be kept at 1 for now.

CVPI has only been tested on the Raspberry Pi, but may support other
platforms.
